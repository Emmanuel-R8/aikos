/* FILE: dlpi.c - Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI) Support
 *
 * This file provides stub support for the Data Link Provider Interface
 * (DLPI), which is a network interface standard. It currently serves as
 * a placeholder for DLPI functionality.
 *
 * HIGH CONFIDENCE: This is a simple stub file that currently only
 * includes the os.h header, providing a minimal DLPI interface.
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * - Provide placeholder for DLPI functionality
 * - Allow compilation without DLPI implementation
 * - Future expansion for network interface support
 *
 * CROSS-REFERENCE: Operating system definitions in os.h
 * CROSS-REFERENCE: Network operations in ether_common.c
 * CROSS-REFERENCE: Ethernet support in ether_nethub.c and ether_sunos.c
