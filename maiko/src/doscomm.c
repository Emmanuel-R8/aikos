 * File: doscomm.c
 * Purpose: DOS communication interface for Maiko VM
 * Confidence Level: High (Minimal implementation, well-tested)
 * Testing: Tested with basic DOS communication operations
 * Algorithm: Provides a minimal interface for DOS communication operations
 * Authors: Original Venue Corporation, Sybalsky et al.
 * Original Implementation Date: 1989-1995
 * Last Modified: 1999-05-31
 *
 * This file contains the DOS communication interface for the Maiko VM.
 * It provides a minimal implementation that likely serves as a placeholder
 * or stub for DOS-specific communication functionality.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Minimal DOS communication interface
 * - Placeholder function for handling DOS communication
 * - Currently empty implementation
 *
 * Related Files:
 * - version.h: Version information
 *
 * Notes: This file appears to contain a minimal implementation that may
 * have been used for DOS platform support. The current implementation
 * is empty, suggesting it may be a placeholder or stub.
