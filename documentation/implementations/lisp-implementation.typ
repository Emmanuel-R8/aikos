== Implementation Statistics

- *Source Files*: 26+ Lisp files
- *Test Files*: 11 test files
- *Opcodes Implemented*: ~191 opcode handlers registered
- *Actual Completeness*: ~30% (sysout loading, Valspace allocation, stack consolidation, 4+ instructions executing)
- *Build System*: ASDF
- *Target Platform*: Linux (SBCL), macOS, Windows (partial)

== Current Status (2026-03-19 00:58)

=== Opcode alignment with Maiko (2026-03-19 00:58)

Laiko now loads `starter.sysout`, enters the startup bytecode, and matches Maiko substantially deeper into the trace than before, but it does #emph[not] yet run to completion.

**2026-03-19 00:58 Update**:
- Implemented `GVAR_` (`0x17`) using Maiko semantics: store cached `TOS` into the atom value cell without changing `TOS`.
- Implemented `LISTP` (`0x03`) using the MDS type table rather than a heuristic.
- Corrected the `JUMPX` family so `JUMPX`, `FJUMPX`, `TJUMPX`, `NFJUMPX`, and `NTJUMPX` use signed 8-bit offsets, while `JUMPXX` uses signed 16-bit offsets.
- Corrected `RETURN` to preserve cached `TOS` and reworked the fast-return path around Maiko's `alink -> PVAR -> FX` model.
- Current blocker: `CONTEXTSWITCH` / runtime FX state restoration still diverges, so execution resumes after `RETURN` in the wrong frame and later crashes in `UNBIND`.

=== ✅ Completed

- ✅ Complete module structure with proper package organization
- ✅ Sysout file loading (BIGVM format, FPtoVP table loading)
- ✅ VM state structure (stack, PC, frame pointers, registers)
- ✅ Dispatch loop with opcode fetching and execution
- ✅ **186+/256 opcodes defined**
- ✅ **Deep startup execution**: loads the sysout, initializes VM state, and executes into the startup control-flow path.
- ✅ **Stack System**: Fully consolidated to use virtual memory byte offsets (matching C/Zig).
- ✅ **Graphics**: Basic opcode definitions compiled without warnings (stubbed or partial).

=== ⚠️ Known Issues

- ⚠️ Graphics opcodes are largely stubs or have unverified implementations.
- ⚠️ Subroutine calls are stubs.
- ⚠️ `CONTEXTSWITCH` is still a stub and does not yet preserve/swap frame state like Maiko.
- ⚠️ `RETURN` slow path (`alink & 1`) is not yet implemented.
- ⚠️ REPL interaction is not yet visible because startup parity is not complete.

=== 🔧 In Progress

- Parity testing against C emulator traces.
- Implementing missing opcodes (graphics, I/O).
- Establishing a persistent REPL loop.

=== Critical Fix: VM Initialization & Stack Logic (2026-03-18)

=== Problem

The VM initialization logic in `laiko/src/main.lisp` was incorrectly calculating the initial Frame Pointer (FP) and Stack Pointer (SP) by mixing absolute Lisp addresses with relative stack offsets.

- **Old Logic**:
  - `FP = STK_OFFSET + (currentfxp * 2)` (Incorrect base)
  - `SP = STK_OFFSET + (nextblock * 2)` (Incorrect base)

- **Correct Logic (Maiko Reference)**:
  - `FP = currentfxp` (Relative offset from start of stack space)
  - `SP = stackbase + 2` (Absolute address from `IFPAGE->stackbase`)
  - `TOS = *stackbase` (Top of stack value)

=== Solution

Updated `initialize-vm-from-ifpage` to match Maiko's `initsout.c`:

1. **FP Calculation**: `currentfxp` from IFPAGE is treated as a relative offset.
2. **SP Calculation**: `stackbase` from IFPAGE is treated as an absolute LispPTR.
3. **TOS Initialization**: The value at `stackbase` is loaded as the initial Top-Of-Stack.

This ensures the VM starts execution in the correct stack frame state, preventing immediate crashes or stack corruption upon the first return.

== Critical Fix: Memory Operations (2026-03-20)

=== Problem

The memory access opcodes (`GETBASEBYTE`, `PUTBASEBYTE`, `GETBASE_N`, `GETBASEPTR_N`, `PUTBASE_N`, `PUTBASEPTR_N`) were incorrectly implemented using simple address arithmetic on stack values, returning addresses instead of reading/writing the memory at those addresses.

- `GETBASEPTR_N` was pushing `base + index*4` (address) instead of reading the pointer at that address.
- `GETBASEBYTE` was incorrectly masking the address instead of reading memory.

=== Solution

Implemented proper memory access using the `vm-read-*` and `vm-write-*` family of functions:

1. **Byte Access**: `GETBASEBYTE`/`PUTBASEBYTE` now use `vm-read-byte` / `vm-write-byte`.
2. **Word Access**: `GETBASE_N`/`PUTBASE_N` now use `vm-read-word` / `vm-write-word` (16-bit).
3. **Pointer Access**: `GETBASEPTR_N`/`PUTBASEPTR_N` now use `vm-read-lispptr` / `vm-write-lispptr` (32-bit).

Added `vm-read-word` and `vm-write-word` to `laiko/src/vm/stack.lisp` to support 16-bit memory operations with Little Endian handling.

== Critical Fix: LISTP Uses the MDS Type Table (2026-03-18)

=== Problem

After fixing `GVAR_`, the next startup failure moved to opcode `0x03`. Investigation against the Maiko dispatch loop showed that `0x03` is `LISTP`, not `LISP`.

The important semantic detail is that Maiko does #emph[not] implement `LISTP` as a simple non-NIL test or as a cons-space heuristic. Instead it consults the MDS type table:

#codeblock(lang: "c", [
#define GetTypeEntry(address)      ( GETWORD(MDStypetbl+((address)>>9)) )
#define GetTypeNumber(address)     (GetTypeEntry(address) & 0x7ff)
#define Listp(address)             (GetTypeNumber(address) == TYPE_LISTP)
])

For BIGVM, `MDStypetbl` is initialized from `MDS_OFFSET` in `build_lisp_map()`.

=== Solution

Laiko now implements opcode `0x03` by reading the 16-bit MDS entry for the page containing `TOS` and comparing its low 11 bits to `TYPE_LISTP = 5`.

This matches the C logic exactly:

1. Compute page index with `lispptr >> 9` (512-byte pages)
2. Read the MDS entry from `MDS_OFFSET`
3. Keep `TOS` unchanged only if the type number is `TYPE_LISTP`
4. Otherwise replace `TOS` with `NIL`

=== Debugging note

The trace-name table in `maiko/src/xc.c` had historically labeled `0x03` as `LISP`, but the actual dispatch switch correctly executes `LISTP`. For parity work, the dispatch switch is the authoritative source.

== Critical Fix: RETURN Preserves Cached TOS and Uses `alink` as a PVAR Pointer (2026-03-19 00:58)

=== Problem

After the `LISTP` and `NTJUMPX` fixes, Laiko advanced to a later `RETURN`, but resumed execution in the wrong frame and eventually crashed in `UNBIND`.

Two Maiko-specific details turned out to be critical:

1. `RETURN` does #emph[not] pop the return value first. It preserves cached `TOPOFSTACK` through frame restoration.
2. In the fast path, raw `alink` is #emph[not] a caller-FX pointer. It points to the caller's PVAR area, and the caller FX is recovered with `alink - FRAMESIZE`.

=== C reference

The relevant Maiko logic is:

#codeblock(lang: "c", [
alink = CURRENTFX->alink;
if (alink & 1) slowreturn();

CSTKPTRL = (LispPTR *) IVAR;
returnFX = (struct frameex2 *)
  ((DLword *)(PVARL = (DLword *) NativeAligned2FromStackOffset(alink))
   - FRAMESIZE);
IVARL = (DLword *) NativeAligned2FromStackOffset(GETWORD((DLword *)returnFX - 1));
PCMACL = returnFX->pc + (ByteCode *)(FuncObj = ...);
])

=== Solution

Laiko now mirrors the fast-path structure more closely:

1. `RETURN` reads the return value from cached `vm-tos`.
2. `return-from-function` reads the active FX from VM using the current frame-pointer offset.
3. Raw `alink` is interpreted as the caller PVAR offset.
4. The caller FX is reconstructed at `alink - FRAMESIZE`.
5. The stack spill pointer is restored from the IVAR word immediately preceding the caller FX.
6. Cached `TOS` is preserved as the return value instead of being pushed back into memory immediately.

=== Current limitation

This fix corrected one major source of stack-model divergence, but it did not fully solve the later resume mismatch. The next remaining issue is that `CONTEXTSWITCH` still does not update runtime FX state the way Maiko does, so the frame visible to `RETURN` is still not the one Maiko would see.

=== Critical Fix: GVAR Bounds Check (2026-03-20)

=== Problem

The `GVAR` instruction was pushing `0` instead of `0x140000` (for Atom 522). This was traced to a bug in `laiko/src/data/atom.lisp` where bounds checks compared byte offsets against page counts:

#codeblock(lang: "lisp", [
(when (>= (+ value-cell-offset 4) (length vmem)) ...)
])

`value-cell-offset` is a byte offset (e.g., 131072), while `(length vmem)` is the number of pages (e.g., 256). This caused valid accesses to fail silently.

=== Solution

Fixed the bounds check logic in `read-atom-value`, `write-atom-value`, and `get-defcell` to correctly compare page indices derived from offsets.

== Critical Fix: Stack System Consolidation (2026-03-01)

=== Problem

Laiko had **two incompatible stack systems** being used inconsistently:

1. **Old System** (`vm-stack-ptr` - array index):
   - `push-stack()`, `pop-stack()`, `get-top-of-stack()`, `set-top-of-stack()`
   - Used by: POP, GETBASEPTR-N, and other opcodes

2. **New System** (`vm-stack-ptr-offset` - byte offset in VM):
   - `vm-push()`, `vm-pop()`, `vm-tos()`, `vm-set-tos()`
   - Used by: GVAR (opcode 0x60)

When GVAR pushed a value using the new system and POP tried to pop using the old system, this caused a **stack underflow** at GETBASEPTR-N.

=== Solution

The old stack functions in `laiko/src/vm/stack.lisp` were redirected to use the new VM-based operations:

#codeblock(lang: "lisp", [
;; DEPRECATED: Old array-based stack functions
;; These now redirect to VM-based stack operations for consistency

(defun push-stack (vm value)
  "Push value onto stack. DEPRECATED - use vm-push instead."
  (vm-push vm (if (typep value 'fixnum) value (logand value #xFFFFFFFF))))

(defun pop-stack (vm)
  "Pop value from stack. DEPRECATED - use vm-pop instead."
  (vm-pop vm))

(defun get-top-of-stack (vm)
  "Get top of stack without popping. DEPRECATED - use vm-tos instead."
  (vm-tos vm))

(defun set-top-of-stack (vm value)
  "Set top of stack. DEPRECATED - use vm-set-tos instead."
  (vm-set-tos vm (if (typep value 'fixnum) value (logand value #xFFFFFFFF))))
])

This ensures all opcodes use the same virtual memory-based stack system, matching the C/Zig implementations.

=== Additional Fixes

- **UNBIND (0x12)**: Implemented proper stack pop per declared `:stack-effect (:pop 1)`
- **GVAR (0x60)**: Fixed to read correctly from Valspace using proper address translation

== Critical Discovery: Valspace Architecture

Valspace pages are **NOT loaded from sysout file**:

#codeblock(lang: "text", [
FPtoVP table has NO entries for VP 3072-3583 (Valspace)
These pages are runtime-allocated memory
C: Valspace = NativeAligned2FromLAddr(VALS_OFFSET) in initsout.c
])

Laiko now allocates Valspace pages at runtime:
- VP 3072-3583 (512 pages, 256KB)
- Zero-initialized
- Values populated by Lisp startup code

- List operations (CAR, CDR, CONS, LIST, APPEND)
- Arithmetic (IPLUS2, IDIFFERENCE, ITIMES2, IQUO, IREM, IADD1, ISUB1)
- Comparison (EQ, EQL, EQUAL, ILESSP, IGREATERP)
- Bitwise (LOGOR2, LOGAND2, LOGXOR2, LOGNOT)
- Shift (LSH, RSH)
- Variable access (GETVAR, SETVAR, GETLOCAL, SETLOCAL)
- Function calls (CALL, RETURN, UNWIND)

- Base address operations (GETBASE, SETBASE)
- Address manipulation (ADDBASE, SUBBASE)
*Remaining*: 67 opcodes (mostly specialized operations, can be added incrementally)

=== Centralized opcode metadata (2026-02-26)

Laiko now uses a single declarative macro (`DEFOP` in `laiko/src/vm/op-macros.lisp`) to define each opcode and populate all dispatch/metadata tables:

- **Primary fields** per opcode are provided as keywords: `:hexcode` (byte value 0–255) and `:instruction-length` (total bytes including operands).
- **Additional metadata** is captured via keywords: `:operands`, `:stack-effect`, `:category`, `:side-effects`, and optional `:aliases`.
- The macro fills:
  - `*instruction-lengths*` (byte → instruction length),
  - `*opcode-names*` (byte → symbolic name),
  - `*opcode-handlers-array*` (byte → handler function),
  - `*opcode-handlers*` (name → handler),
  - `*opcode-metadata*` (name → plist of all fields, including documentation).

This keeps the opcode table as the **single source of truth** for both the dispatcher and tooling (documentation generation, parity debugging, future introspection) and mirrors the centralized tables used in the C and Zig implementations.

=== Opcode prioritization for parity work (2026-02-26)

For Laiko, opcode implementation order is now driven by **trace-based divergence** rather than raw opcode number:

- Tier 1: early-executed core instructions (stack operations, constants, variable access, control flow, base/memory ops that appear in the first few instructions of starter.sysout).
- Tier 2: data and memory structure operations (lists, arrays, general arithmetic/comparisons, bitwise and shifts).
- Tier 3: floating point, graphics, and advanced I/O (BitBLT, SDL display, subroutine I/O).

When running `scripts/compare_emulator_execution.sh --with-laiko` with a small `EMULATOR_MAX_STEPS`, the **first divergence (PC + opcode)** determines which tier to work on next. See `reports/laiko-opcode-priority.md` for the current tier breakdown and concrete examples.

=== Memory Management

*Storage*:
- Heap allocation with DLword-aligned blocks
- Free list management for efficient allocation
- Storage full detection

*Garbage Collection*:
- Hash table-based reference counting
- Stack reference marking
- GC enable/disable control
- Reclaim countdown mechanism

*Virtual Memory*:
- FPtoVP (File Page to Virtual Page) mapping
- Page-based address translation
- Support for sysout file page mapping

*Sysout Loading*:
- Endianness-aware reading (little-endian)
- IFPAGE structure parsing
- Version compatibility checking
- Keyval validation

=== Error Handling

*Error Conditions*:
- `vm-error`: VM execution errors
- `memory-error`: Memory allocation/access errors
- `display-error`: Display initialization/rendering errors
- `io-error`: I/O operation errors
- `sysout-load-failed`: Sysout file loading errors
- `invalid-address`: Address translation errors

*Edge Cases Handled*:
- Sysout version mismatch
- Memory allocation failures
- SDL initialization failures
- Invalid address access
- End-of-file during sysout reading

=== Platform Support

*Endianness*:
- Platform-specific detection via `sb-sys:machine-type`
- Little-endian byte order for sysout files
- Word size handling (32-bit LispPTR, 16-bit DLword)

*Pathname Translation*:
- Unix-style paths (forward slashes)
- Windows-style paths (backslashes, drive letters)
- Platform-agnostic pathname handling

== Testing

*Test Coverage*:
- Opcode execution tests
- Stack management tests
- Dispatch loop tests
- Memory allocation tests
- GC operation tests
- Sysout loading tests
- Keyboard/mouse event tests
- Display operation tests
- Filesystem operation tests
- Compatibility tests

*Test Framework*: FiveAM

== Performance Considerations

- *Correctness First*: Implementation prioritizes correctness over performance
- *Type Declarations*: Used throughout for SBCL optimization hints
- *Profiling*: Performance profiling deferred until correctness verified (T077)

== Known Limitations

1. *SDL3*: Requires `cl-sdl3` library for full functionality (currently stubbed)
2. *Bytecode Extraction*: Sysout bytecode extraction not yet implemented
3. *Some Opcodes*: 67 opcodes not yet implemented (stub implementations)
4. *GC Coordination*: Basic coordination implemented, may need refinement

== Lessons Learned

=== Common Lisp Specific

1. *ASDF Dependencies*: Making dependencies optional improves build flexibility
2. *Type Declarations*: Critical for SBCL optimization
3. *Package System*: Well-organized packages improve code maintainability
4. *Error Conditions*: Custom error types provide better error handling

=== Implementation Challenges

1. *Opcode Conflicts*: Some opcode values were overloaded in C implementation - resolved by prioritizing `opcodes.h` definitions
2. *Endianness*: Platform-specific handling required for sysout compatibility
3. *Memory Mapping*: FPtoVP mapping requires careful address translation
4. *Dispatch Loop*: Variable-length instructions require careful operand fetching

=== Design Decisions

1. *Stub First*: Created stub implementations for all subsystems, then filled in details
2. *Test-Driven*: Created test files before implementation
3. *Modular Design*: Clear separation between VM, memory, display, and I/O
4. *Error Handling*: Comprehensive error conditions for debugging

== Future Work

1. *Complete Opcodes*: Implement remaining 67 opcode handlers
2. *SDL3 Integration*: Integrate `cl-sdl3` for full SDL3 support
3. *Bytecode Extraction*: Implement bytecode extraction from sysout files
4. *Compatibility Tests*: Add reference test data for compatibility testing
5. *Performance Optimization*: Profile and optimize after correctness verification
