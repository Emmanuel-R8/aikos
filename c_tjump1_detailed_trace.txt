=== DETAILED TJUMP1 TRACING (Instruction #6) ===

PC (byte pointer): 0x7fffc060f13a
PC offset from Lisp_world: 0x60f13a bytes (0x30789d DLwords)
PCMACL (before jump): 3227578683

=== Stack State Before TJUMP1 ===
  TopOfStack (TOS): 0x00000000
  TOS == 0? YES (NIL/false)

=== Jump Decision ===
  TJUMP1: Jump if TOS != 0 (true), else continue
  Decision: TOS == 0 (NIL), so NO JUMP
  Action: POP, then nextop1 (advance PC by 1)

=== Expected PC After TJUMP1 ===
  No jump: PC will advance by 1 byte
  New PC: 0x60f13a + 1 = 0x60f13b
